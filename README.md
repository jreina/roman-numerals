Convert Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals and vice-versa.

Work in progress. The conversion both directions appears to be working, but I don't know how to do the subtraction thing properly when going from Arabic to Roman numerals. The numbers are literally correct, but things come out with stuff like `dcccc` instead of `cm`.
